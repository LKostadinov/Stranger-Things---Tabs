            The first season begins on November 6, 1983, when researchers at
            Hawkins National Laboratory open a rift to the "Upside Down", an
            alternate dimension that reflects onto the real world. A monstrous
            humanoid creature escapes and abducts a boy named Will Byers and a
            teenage girl named Barbara Holland. Will's mother, Joyce, and the
            town's police chief, Jim Hopper, search for Will. At the same time,
            a young psychokinetic girl who goes by the name "Eleven" escapes
            from the laboratory and assists Will's friends, Mike Wheeler, Dustin
            Henderson, and Lucas Sinclair, in their own efforts to find Will.

            In fall 1984, Will Byers finds himself the target of the Upside Down
            as a large tentacled entity called the Mind Flayer soon terrorizes
            the citizens of Hawkins, drawing back Joyce and Hopper along with
            Mike's sister Nancy, Will's brother Jonathan, Nancy's boyfriend
            Steve, as well as Will's close friends Mike, Dustin and Lucas. The

            In the summer of 1985 in Hawkins, the newly opened Starcourt Mall
            has become the center of attention in the town, causing other stores
            to close their business due to its popularity. Hopper disapproves of
            Eleven and Mike's relationship. Joyce considers moving out of
            Hawkins with her children. Joyce enlists the help of Hopper to
            investigate the reason behind her magnet losing its magnetism. Will
            begins having premonitions regarding the Upside Down, despite Eleven
            having closed the portal. The Mind Flayer takes control of Billy's
            mind, leaving Eleven and her friends no choice but to battle him.

            Set in March 1986, eight months after the events of the third
            season, the fourth season is split between different plotlines. The
            first plotline takes place in Hawkins, where several teenagers are
            killed in mysterious ways. It features Dustin Henderson, Max
            Mayfield, Lucas and Erica Sinclair, Steve Harrington, Nancy Wheeler,
            Robin Buckley, and Eddie Munson, the leader of the Hellfire Club; a
            Dungeons & Dragons group that includes Dustin and his friends. Eddie
            becomes the prime murder suspect and is hunted down by Jason Carver
            and members of the basketball team, who believe that Eddie killed
            Jason's girlfriend, Chrissy Cunningham, using satanic powers. Dustin
            and friends investigate and discover that the murders were carried
            out by a powerful being that lives in the Upside Down, whom they
            later dub "Vecna". The second plotline involves Mike Wheeler
            visiting Eleven, Will and Jonathan Byers at their new home in
            California. Due to the events in Hawkins and the imminent danger to
            her friends, Eleven goes with Dr. Martin Brenner and Sam Owens to a
            secret facility to help her regain her powers. Mike, Will, Jonathan
            and Jonathan's friend Argyle try to track Eleven down. The third
            plotline follows Joyce Byers and Murray Bauman when they learn that
            Jim Hopper may still be alive. They are told to bring money to
            arrange for his transfer. Meanwhile, in a Soviet prison camp in
            Kamchatka, Hopper is held prisoner and is forced, alongside other
            inmates, to battle a Demogorgon that the Russians have captured.
